# ToDo
This is an archive of the original ToDoFy made with jQuery and PHP.

It is not under active development. At max I may update versions of the libraries referred in here (bootstrap, jquery) and make it compatible with newer versions but otherwise no.


Although I am still other ToDoFys using different tech stacks (one with .NET and one with JavaScript, more may be added in the future)

Please take these as fun projects only, they're not meant to be mainstream and yes they do contain a lot of badly written code.
